Official Liferay Docker Image Tutorials
=======================================

(`LRSUPPORT-38245 <https://issues.liferay.com/browse/LRSUPPORT-38245>`_)

This set of tutorials are meant to illustrate, extend and complement the materials in the `Liferay Docker Images Skill Map <https://grow.liferay.com/people/Docker+Skill+Map+for+Customer+Support>`_. Not every material in the skill map is covered in the tutorials, because the goal is to enable reader to practise some key aspects related to Liferay Docker images and container operation.

New tutorials may be added if a clear need is identified.

Index:

* `Basic Operations tutorial <00_basic_liferay_container_operations.rst>`_ covers some essential tasks related to container management as well as some fundamental concepts about our Liferay images. It complements levels 1d, 2d and 2e sections in the skillmap
* `Advanced Operations tutorial <03_advanced_liferay_container_operations.rst>`_ covers some of the advanced operations described in level 3b, and is also related to the knowledge acquired in levels 2b, 2c and 3c.
* `Liferay in multi-container setting  <04_liferay_in_multicontainer.rst>`_ covers the basics to create multi-container orchestrated Liferay-based applications, including clustering Liferay containers. It complements level 3a in the sillmap.
